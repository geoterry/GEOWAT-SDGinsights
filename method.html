            Although SDG monitoring on drinking-water progress is often based on national level indicators, sub-nationally and geospatially disaggregated indicators may become increasingly important as they could effectively reveal inequalities in services between different geographic locations and population groups. As more recent concerns are raised about issues such as water quality, functionality of facility, and continuity of service, it may also become increasingly important to disaggregate data by specific type of water service. As more geospatial data sources become available with the transition from the MDGs to the SDGs, predicting the potential spatial distribution of specific type(s) of drinking-water source using machine learning method becomes possible. DHS modelled surfaces as one of such novel data could potentially be the important sources of predictive covariates in modelling the potential distribution of specific type(s) of drinking-water access or service.

            Achieving universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all requires evidence-based assessments to identify the disadvantaged areas and prioritise those with the most needs accordingly. 
            To facilitate drinking water infrastructure development to deliver safe and sustainable water services for all, 
            it is necessary to locate the people still using disadvantaged water services across the country. 
            Surface water at the bottom of WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP)â€™s <a href="https://washdata.org/monitoring/drinking-water">water ladder</a> refers to drinking water directly from open sources such as a river, stream, lake, dam, pond, canal or irrigation channel. 
            Fetching water from open sources may pick up contaminants and pathogens; 
            without proper treatment before use, it may cause serious health effects. 
            Although conventional geospatial datasets concerning drinking water services generally contain comparatively limited information on surface water sources, 
            more newly released datasets combining machine learning predictive modelling methods makes it possible to predict the potential spatial distribution of specific types of disadvantaged water service such as surface water. <br>

            This study uses a novel machine learning algorithm named maximum entropy (MaxEnt) to predict the potential spatial distribution of surface water drinking sources in Liberia. 
            Surface water point data derived from the Water Point Exchange are employed as observed occurrence sample of surface water; 
            whilst data indicating factors that may be potentially important determinants of the spatial distribution of surface water drinking sources are used as predictive covariates for the MaxEnt modelling.

            The following maps show the 5km resolution predicted potential spatial distribution of surface water sources in Liberia. 
            This is merely a simplified model for the illustration of this idea. 
            A comparatively precise model can be conducted at finer resolution with sufficient geospatial data and a systematic conceptual framework identifying technical and socio-economic factors that may affect the distribution of specific water sources.
            Surely, such prediction should not directly replace national scale water point inventory or nationally representative household surveys. 
            However, it could give a brief indication of the likely spatial distribution of specific type of water sources in areas where data is lacking.
