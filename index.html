            After the expiry of the United Nations’ Millennium DevelopmentGoals (MDGs) in 2015, the international focus on water and sanitation has shifted to a broader agenda through the SDG 6. 
            The ongoing development of indicators for enhanced monitoring of progress towards the SDG targets is likely to place greater demands on existing datasets.
            Between MDG 7c and SDG 6, many more forms of data concerning drinking-water and sanitation have become available. 
            One such form of data is the spatial interpolation surfaces from USAID's Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) Program,
            which reports public health-related indicators such as water source (population living in households using an improved water source) and sanitation (population living in households using no toilet facility) in grid cell for least developed countries.

            Although SDG monitoring on drinking-water progress is often based on national level indicators, 
            sub-nationally and geospatially disaggregated indicators may become increasingly important as they could effectively reveal inequalities in services between different geographic locations and population groups. 
            As more recent concerns are raised about issues such as water quality, functionality of facility, and continuity of service, it may also become increasingly important to disaggregate data by specific type of water service. 
            Currently, disadvantaged drinking water services are not often reported at high levels of geospatial disaggregation. 
            Fortunately, as more geospatial data sources become available with the transition from the MDGs to the SDGs, predicting the potential spatial distribution of specific type(s) of drinking-water source using machine learning method becomes possible. 
            DHS modelled surfaces as one of such novel data could potentially be the important sources of predictive covariates for modelling the potential distribution of specific type(s) of drinking-water service.

            Achieving universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all requires evidence-based assessments to identify the disadvantaged areas and prioritise those with the most needs accordingly. 
            To facilitate drinking water infrastructure development to deliver safe and sustainable water services for all, 
            it is necessary to locate the people still using disadvantaged water services across the country. 
            Surface water at the bottom of WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP)’s <a href="https://washdata.org/monitoring/drinking-water">water ladder</a> refers to drinking water directly from open sources such as a river, stream, lake, dam, pond, canal or irrigation channel. 
            Fetching water from open sources may pick up contaminants and pathogens; 
            without proper treatment before use, it may cause serious health effects. 
            Although conventional geospatial datasets concerning drinking water services generally contain comparatively limited information on surface water sources, 
            more newly released datasets combining machine learning predictive modelling methods makes it possible to predict the potential spatial distribution of specific types of disadvantaged water service such as surface water. <br>

            Inequalities are often more pronounced in maps at finer levels of spatial disaggregation.
            The following maps illustrate data concerning surface water drinking sources in Liberia by DHS region (left - DHS 2007), county (middle - Census 2008), and 5km x 5km grid square (right - MaxEnt prediction) respectively.

            The following maps show the spatial coverages of improved water source (left) and open defecation (right) by wealth in Tanzania. 
            Similarly, rich areas show overall better situations than poor areas on both maps. 
            The numbers in the zonal statistics table needs to be interpreted with caution in terms of national comparison,
            as in this case we are counting the geographic areas across the countries rather than the actual populated areas.
